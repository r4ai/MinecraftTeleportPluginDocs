# Introduction

[Minecraft Teleport Plugin](https://github.com/r4ai/MinecraftTeleportPlugin) is a simple plugin which adds some items, commands and events to teleport players.

I'm a beginner in Java and I made this plugin for fun and to learn more about Java and Minecraft plugins.
Therefore, the code is not perfect and there are some bugs. Please forgive me for that.
